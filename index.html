      <p class="lead">
        Are you tired of facing technical issues on your computers? Say goodbye to frustrating IT
        problems with our exclusive Remote Support Plan, available at an <strong> unbeatable price of just £10 per
          month!</strong> (Subject to a fair usage policy, for Home Users and Small Businesses only up to 3 computers)
      </p>
      <h5>What is remote support:</h5>
      <p class="lead">
        Remote support enables us to fix most IT issues by connecting remotely to your computer. It means we can access
        your
        computers to provide maintenance and support without being physically in the room with you. Once connected,
        we take control of the computer we're servicing and perform whatever task is needed, such as installing updates
        or troubleshooting issues. We can fix most IT issues by remote connection apart from the exception of a computer
        not turning on, hardware faults and internet access issues. In these cases, we can either perform the work on
        site,
        or you can bring your computer to us.

        If you're a dedicated gamer seeking unmatched performance, customisation, and cost-effectiveness,
        building a gaming PC tailored to your needs is the ultimate solution.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Here at Fix I.T. Computer Services we can build your ultimate gaming PC for you.

        <strong>Why Build to Specification?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Off-the-shelf gaming PCs might offer convenience, but they often come with a premium price tag
        and limitations on customisation. When you build your own gaming PC to spec, you're in control.
        You can choose every component, from the CPU and GPU to the RAM, storage, and cooling
        solutions. This ensures that your PC is optimized for your gaming preferences, future-proofed for
        upcoming releases, and tailored to your budget.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        <strong>Set Your Budget:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Determine how much you&#39;re willing to invest in your gaming rig. This will influence
        your component choices and help you find the best balance between performance and cost.

      <p class="lead">
        <strong>Identify Your Gaming Goals:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Are you aiming for 1080p, 1440p, or even 4K gaming? Do you prioritize

                      of conversations regarding spec and things that were important for our son to improve his gaming experience. 
                      Paul made recommendations for the new monitor to ensure compatibility with the PC's components.

                      Within a few days, the build was complete and we were able to collect. We now have a powerful, 
                      capable, upgradable, whisper quiet PC with LED's a plenty. Expertly built machine and the aftercare 
                      has been second to none. Would highly recommend. Our son is now thoroughly enjoying his gaming once again!"

                        "Paul's brilliant. I took the plunge and asked for his help to upgrade my 
                        'dinosaur' of an old laptop, which was on its last legs, to something more 
                        modern. I picked up my reconditioned laptop yesterday. Verdict 10/10. He's 
                        efficient, approachable, helpful and gets the job done in super quick time. 
                        Excellent service...give Fix I.T. Computer Services a go, would highly recommend. Cheers Paul."
