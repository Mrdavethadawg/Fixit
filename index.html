                          "We contacted Fix I.T to build a custom gaming PC for our son after his laptop had run out of
                          space.
                          We had lots of conversations regarding spec and things that were important for our son to
                          improve his gaming experience.
                          Paul made recommendations for the new monitor to ensure compatibility with the PC's
                          components.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Within a few days, the build was complete and we were able to collect. We now have a powerful,
                          capable, upgradable, whisper quiet PC with LED's a plenty.
                          Expertly built machine and the aftercare has been second to none. Would highly recommend. Our
                          son is now thoroughly enjoying his gaming once again!""
